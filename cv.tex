	\textbf{Software engineer at Yandex, intern, June 2019 - September 2019} \\[2mm]
	\par
	I worked in Yandex.Images and I dealt with related images mostly. I worked in group which improves quality of the related images. I often used MapReduce and SQL queries.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Decreased by two and a half times the size of the related images database weight by finding better document distribution. Document is a set of identical images with different sizes, crop factors and other characteristics.		
		\item Increased coverage of documents with related images by $3\%$   
		\item Increased document relevance in image collections by $10\%$ using \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent}{gradient descent} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing}{simulated annealing} to find better query params\vspace{1pt}
